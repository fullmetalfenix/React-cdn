# React via CDN

Just for local development of small proofs of concepts and workshop type things - React without the overhead.

Notes:
- order of componenets matter
- you dont have to import or export anything
- demo-config.js should be renamed to just config.js
- Need to have a way to serve this otherwise will get errors. If you don't have one already I am using http-server (npm install -g http-server -> in the console type http-server to start)
